For the first homework, try to accomplish the following:
1. Start a new project to build an ecommerce website.
2. Create a component to display a single product.
3. The product component should display a name, price, and image for the product.
You can initialize the component with some defaults for the same. Use any place‚Äê
holder image you want. In the class which represents product image should be stored as url to the relative path of an image.
4. Highlight the entire element in a different color if the product is on sale. Whether
the product is on sale can be an attribute of the product itself.
5. Add buttons to increase and decrease the quantity of the product in the cart. The
quantity in the cart (this is related to product, so how much of each product is added to cart) should be visible in the UI. Disable the button for descrement if the quantity
is already zero.

Solutions of each homework will be posted after the next class. You can use the solutions to check your work. However, you should try to solve the problems on your own first. If you get stuck, feel free to contact me.
